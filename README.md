## SoftUni JS Back-End Course Key Technologies and Features

Here‚Äôs an overview of key technologies and features covered in this course:

### **Node.js Streams and Utilities**  
Efficiently handle I/O operations with Node.js streams to improve memory management and performance in data processing. Common utilities are included to simplify frequent tasks, boosting productivity.

### **Express.js and Templating**  
Build the web application using Express.js, a flexible Node.js framework. It enables quick routing, middleware integration, and a clean project structure. A templating engine (such as **Handlebars**) is used for rendering dynamic content on the client-side.

### **NoSQL and MongoDB**  
MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is used to store data. Its flexible schema allows for rapid development and scaling as the project grows.

### **Mongoose**  
Mongoose simplifies interaction with MongoDB by providing a schema-based solution for modeling data. It enables features such as validation, querying, and population of related data.

### **Sessions and Authentication**  
Sessions are implemented to track user activity across multiple requests. Authentication, including login and sign-up functionality, ensures that user data is secure.

### **Validation and Error Handling**  
Input validation ensures that user-entered data is in the correct format. Errors are handled gracefully, with user-friendly messages and robust logging for debugging.
