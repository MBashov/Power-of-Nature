# SoftUni JS Back-End Exam Task
## Key Technologies and Features 
**Node.js Streams and Utilities**  
  Efficiently handle I/O operations with Node.js streams, improving memory management and performance in data processing. Common utilities are included to simplify frequent tasks, boosting productivity.

**ExpressJS and Templating**  
  Build the web application using Express.js, a flexible Node.js framework. This enables quick routing, middleware integration, and a clean project structure. Templating engines (such as EJS or Pug) are used for     rendering dynamic content on the client side.

**NoSQL and MongoDB**  
MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is used for storing data. Its flexible schema allows rapid development and scaling as the project grows.

**Mongoose**  
Mongoose simplifies interaction with MongoDB by providing a schema-based solution for modeling data. It also enables features such as validation, querying, and population of related data.

**Sessions and Authentication**  
Sessions are implemented to track user activity across multiple requests. Authentication, including login and sign-up functionality, ensures secure user data.

**Validation and Error Handling**  
Input validation ensures that user-entered data is in the correct format. Errors are handled gracefully with user-friendly messages and robust logging for debugging.
