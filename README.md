# Power-Of-Nature
## SoftUni JS Back-End Exam Task
### Key Technologies and Features 
* Node.js Streams and Utilities
Utilize Node.js streams to efficiently handle I/O operations, allowing for better memory management and performance in data processing. Common utilities are included to simplify common tasks and boost productivity.

* ExpressJS and Templating
Build the web application using ExpressJS, a flexible Node.js framework. This allows for quick routing, middleware integration, and a clean project structure. We use templating engines (like EJS or Pug) for rendering dynamic content on the client-side.

* NoSQL and MongoDB
The application uses MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for storing data. MongoDB's flexible schema allows for rapid development and scaling as the project grows.

* Mongoose
We use Mongoose to simplify interaction with MongoDB. This provides a schema-based solution to modeling data and enables features like validation, querying, and population of related data.

* Sessions and Authentication
Sessions are managed to keep track of user activity across multiple requests. Authentication, including login and sign-up functionality, ensures that users' data is secure.

* Validation and Error Handling
Input validation is implemented to ensure that data entered by users is in the correct format. We also handle errors gracefully, with user-friendly messages and logging for debugging.
### Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes
 * Development of server-side JavaScript applications on the Node.js platform, using Express.js as a framework.
 * Create a server with Node.js, learn the client-server architecture and how to create simple and fast data-driven web applications with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.   
 * One of the most popular non-relational databases - MongoDB, will be examined, along with the Mongoose library for retrieving data from it.
 * By the end of the course, a complete REST API will be built from scratch, using Express.js and MongoDB.
 * The course will emphasize practical exercises, through which it will involve participants in real projects for developing web pages, implementing site fragments and creating complete modern websites with a good vision, modern structure and mobile support.
